## PostgreSQL Installation instructions

Follow the instructions from the PostgreSQL step in [UpLeveled's System Setup Instructions](https://github.com/upleveled/system-setup/blob/master/readme.md).

Run the following queries inside of `psql` to set up the database and the user:

```sql
CREATE DATABASE <database name>;
CREATE USER <user name> WITH ENCRYPTED PASSWORD '<user password>';
GRANT ALL PRIVILEGES ON DATABASE <database name> TO <user name>;
```

Then, to connect to the database using this new user, quit `psql` and reconnect:

```sh
\q
psql -U <user name> <database name>
```

-- you could use \connect <database name> to connect to an other database, but you have no permission for table product

Migrations are set up with Ley.
