## Technologies used

This project is a Next.js app which makes use of a PostgresQL database and API (themoviedb) Data fetching

## Using API Key

- you should add environment variables to the JavaScript bundle, open next.config.js and add the env config
- Access process.env.customKey in code
- Next.js will replace process.env.customKey with 'my-value' at build time. Trying to destructure process.env variables won't work due to the nature of webpack DefinePlugin.

# PostgreSQL

- [Postgres.js](https://github.com/porsager/postgres) database client
- [Ley](https://github.com/lukeed/ley) for database migrations

## PostgreSQL Installation instructions

Follow the instructions from the PostgreSQL step in [UpLeveled's System Setup Instructions](https://github.com/upleveled/system-setup/blob/master/readme.md).

Run the following queries inside of `psql` to set up the database and the user:

```sql
CREATE DATABASE <database name>;
CREATE USER <user name> WITH ENCRYPTED PASSWORD '<user password>';
GRANT ALL PRIVILEGES ON DATABASE <database name> TO <user name>;
```

Then, to connect to the database using this new user, quit `psql` and reconnect:

```sh
\q
psql -U <user name> <database name>
```

- you could use \connect <database name> to connect to an other database, but you have no permission for table product

Migrations are set up with Ley.

# Database migrations

- [ ] driver support:
  - [x] [`pg`](https://www.npmjs.com/package/pg)
  - [x] [`postgres`](https://www.npmjs.com/package/postgres)
  - [x] [`mysql`]()
  - [x] [`mysql2`]()
  - [x] [`better-sqlite3`](https://www.npmjs.com/package/better-sqlite3)
  - [ ] [`sqlite`](https://www.npmjs.com/package/sqlite)
- [ ] complete test coverage
- [ ] complete documentation

## Features

- **Agnostic**<br>
  _Supports [`postgres`](https://www.npmjs.com/package/postgres), [`pg`](https://www.npmjs.com/package/pg), [`better-sqlite3`](https://www.npmjs.com/package/better-sqlite3), [`sqlite`](https://www.npmjs.com/package/sqlite), [`mysql`](https://www.npmjs.com/package/mysql), and [`mysql2`](https://www.npmjs.com/package/mysql2)_

- **Lightweight**<br>
  _Does **not** include any driver dependencies._

- **Transactional**<br>
  _Runs all migration files within a transaction for rollback safety._

- **Familiar**<br>
  _Does **not** invent new syntax or abstractions.<br>You're always working directly with your driver of choice._

- **Flexible**<br>
  _Find the CLI to restrictive? You may require `ley` for your own scripting!_

## Install

```
$ npm install --save-dev ley or yarn add ley
```

## Usage

> Both [Programmatic](#programmatic) and [CLI](#cli) usages are supported.

### Setup

You must have a `migrations` directory created, preferably in your project's root.

> **Note:** You may configure the target directory and location.

Your filenames within this directory determine _the order of their execution._<br>
Because of this, it's often recommended to prefix migrations with a timestamp or numerical sequence.

**_Numerical Sequence_**

```
/migrations
  |-- 00000-users.js
  |-- 00001-teams.js
  |-- 00002-seats.js
```

> **Note**: You may create the next file via `ley new todos --length 3` where `todos` is a meaningful name.<br>The above command will create the `migrations/003-todos.js` filepath.

**_Timestamped_**

```
/migrations
  |-- 1581323445-users.js
  |-- 1581323453-teams.js
  |-- 1581323458-seats.js
```

Each migration file must have an `up` and a `down` task.<br>
These must be exported functions &mdash; `async` okay! &mdash; and will receive your pre-installed client driver as its only argument:

```js
exports.up = async function (DB) {
  // with `pg` :: DB === pg.Client
  await DB.query(`select * from users`);

  // with `postgres` :: DB === sql``
  await DB`select * from users`;
};

exports.down = async function (DB) {
  // My pre-configured "undo" function
};
```

### CLI

1. Add `ley` as one of your `package.json` scripts; `"migrate"`, for example:

   ```js
   // package.json
   {
     "scripts": {
       "migrate": "ley"
     }
   }
   ```

2. Add dotenv-cli with yarn add dotenv-cli, it will added to dependencies in package.json

3. Invoke `ley up` to apply new migrations, or `ley down` to rollback previous migrations.

   ```sh
   $ npm run migrate up
   $ yarn migrate up
   ```

4. Create table with `yarn ley new create-YOUR TABLE NAME-table`

5. Insert content into table with `yarn ley new insert-YOUR TABLE NAME`

### Programmatic

> **Note:** See [API](#api) for documentation

With programmatic/scripting usage, you will not inherit any of `ley`'s CLI tooling, which includes all colors and error formatting. Instead, you must manually catch & handle all thrown Errors.

```js
const ley = require('ley');

const successes = await ley.up({ ... });
```
